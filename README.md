## PDF Extraction, Summarization and Visualization App


A PDF document is not so great in terms of searching and indexing and it becomes an overwhelming task to search through many documents individually or compare two or more documents manually.
This application helps to get useful insights from PDF documents by creating visualizations and summarizations. It also enables searching, sorting and filtering. We can browse through lots of documents in a single click and get a summary and comparison of the documents in minutes.
Upload PDF documents from disk and/or provide links of PDF documents. Then go to the Summaries section in the sidebar to get summaries of the uploaded documents. We can search one or more terms and see their distribution across the uploaded documents in the Search and Filter menu item. We can also filter to display words with certain frequency range only.
